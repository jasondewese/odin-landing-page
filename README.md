# odin-landing-page
Final project of the Odin Project's Foundations course section to practice HTML and CSS. 

The final layout should look something like this design: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png 


The font and color info can be found here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png 


In this project I learned/practiced:
    - How to import webfonts from google
    - How to edit font faces to add more options (like light italics)
    - How to add and style borders
    - Using box-sizing: border box to make sizing content much easier
    - How to use padding and margins to space out content properly
    - Using a more structured approach to the design phase
        - Creating intial box design on paper
        - Creating html for one section at a time, then styling after the structure is complete
        - Moving from the top of the page to the bottom
        - Using git commit for each logical stage of design before moving on
